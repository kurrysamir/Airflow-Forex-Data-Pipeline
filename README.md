# Airflow-Forex-Data-Pipeline

In this case, the EURO fluctuates against the USD. Right now, one euro is equal to dot zero eight dollars.

And that's what we are going to manipulate in the forex date pipeline.
Not as complicated as this, but we are going to fetch some values of pair of currencies and then process them.

Created the first fully functional data pipeline that interacts with one of the most important tools in the tech industry!
Used the below bunch of operators :

HttpSensor,

FileSensor, 

PythonOperator,

BashOperator,

HiveOperator,

SparkSubmitOperator,

EmailOperator,

SlackWebhookOperator.
